# English Grammar

The goal of this project is to use the concepts behind programming languages to help programmers better understand English grammar.

It's built in Ruby using class inheritance. Though inheritance is generally not the best approach to programming, I'm using it here because it's a really useful tool for explaining the concept of grammatical inheritance.

This project is very new and very much a WIP.
